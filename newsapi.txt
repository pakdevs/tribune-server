Provider recommendations and notes (Sept 6, 2025)

App-tailored pick
- Primary: Event Registry (aka NewsAPI.ai)
	- Strong source/country controls, entities/dedup, multilingual (Urdu+English), solid PK coverage.
- Fallback: Bing News Search (Azure)
	- Reliable mainstream coverage, simple filters, good for quota fallback.
- Budget alt: Newscatcher + Bing
	- Decent freshness/filters; control quality with a Pakistan domain allowlist.
  
	- Pros: news+blogs+forums, rich Lucene queries, large archive. Cons: pricier, crawl-based licensing, needs strict whitelists/dedupe.
- Research/trends supplement: GDELT (not primary feed)
	- Massive global signal; useful for trend alerts and geo/event analysis; noisy for article lists.

Filtering constraints (quick refs)
- GNews (gnews.io): country=yes; source filter=no (approximate via q=site:domain.com OR ...).
- NewsAPI.org: sources=yes (IDs), domains/excludeDomains; country only on top-headlines; cannot combine sources with country/category on top-headlines; /everything has no country.

NewsAPI.ai relation
- NewsAPI.ai is operated by Event Registry (same backend/corpus/ML). Not related to NewsAPI.org.

Feature highlights across providers (beyond basics)
-- Coverage/archive: depth from months to multi-year backfills (Event Registry, enterprise vendors).
- Query/filtering: boolean/Lucene, field filters, domain whitelists/blacklists, region/country, categories.
- Enrichment: entities, topics/taxonomy, sentiment, summarization, dedup/clustering, geo extraction.
- Delivery: REST, streaming/firehose, webhooks; bulk export on higher tiers.
- Analytics: trends/time series, event detection, related stories.
- Compliance: snippet vs full-text rights, caching/retention rules vary by vendor.

Pakistan-focused allowlist (starter set)
- dawn.com, thenews.com.pk, tribune.com.pk, geo.tv, arynews.tv, samaa.tv,
	brecorder.com, nation.com.pk, pakistantoday.com.pk, dailytimes.com.pk, 92news.pk.

Practical integration steps (server)
- Providers: implement Event Registry (primary) and Bing (fallback) in tribune-server/api/_providers.ts
	and map fields in tribune-server/api/_normalize.ts.
-- Env keys: GNEWS_API (current), others optional for future expansions.
- Normalization: map to { title, description, url, image, source, publishedAt, language } and
	dedupe by hostname+title; apply language filter (en, ur) and domain allowlist for PK sources.

Notes
-- If strict source+country control is required, consider Event Registry (supports complex filters).
- For cost-sensitive start, Newscatcher (+ Bing fallback) is viable; upgrade to Event Registry as traffic grows.

AI summaries, sentiment, and translation (future optional modules)
	- Sentiment: yes (article-level).
	- Enrichment: entities, categories/taxonomy, fake-news/satire and political-slant tags, dedupe, readability/full-text extraction.
	- Summaries: no standard summary field by default; highlights/snippets available. Some enterprise add-ons may offer summaries (sales-enabled).
	- Translation: returns original language (no auto-translate to Urdu/English).
- Event Registry (NewsAPI.ai)
	- Sentiment: yes (article/story-level).
	- Enrichment: concepts/entities, categories, cross-lingual story clustering, related articles, dedupe.
	- Summaries: short machine summaries available on some endpoints/plans (not guaranteed on all tiers).
	- Translation: generally not; focuses on cross-lingual linking rather than delivering translated text.

Recommended app approach
- Prefer native Urdu sources for Urdu readers (lang=ur + PK allowlist).
- For English-only items when user language is Urdu: perform server-side translation and/or summarization; label as "AI-generated" and cache per (url,targetLang).
